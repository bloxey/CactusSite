    <h3> Cactus Growing Conditions </h3>

    <p>
      The cacti families are succulents which store moisture in their pads,
      stems and trunks to use during dry and drought periods.
      They are generally found in desert conditions, although a few are tropical to sub-tropical.
      The plants favor sunny locations with plenty of heat, areas which have little to no rainfall and harsh soil.
      The majority of the family will make excellent houseplants due to their minimal needs and forgiving nature.
      These hardy plants do need water but not on the scale that the average plant requires.
      They are unique in form and flower with an ease of care that borders on neglect.
      They prefer a cactus growing mix that is partially sand or grit, some soil and a pinch of peat moss.

    <h3> What Internet tells us about cactuses?</h3>
    <p>
      Cactus spines are produced from specialized structures called areoles,
      a kind of highly reduced branch. Areoles are an identifying feature of cacti.
      As well as spines, areoles give rise to flowers, which are usually tubular and multipetaled.
      Many cacti have short growing seasons and long dormancies, and are able to react quickly to any rainfall,
      helped by an extensive but relatively shallow root system that quickly absorbs any water reaching the ground
      surface.
      Cactus stems are often ribbed or fluted, which allows them to expand and contract easily for quick water
      absorption after rain,
      followed by long drought periods. Like other succulent plants, most cacti employ a special mechanism called
      "crassulacean acid
      metabolism" (CAM) as part of photosynthesis. Transpiration, during which carbon dioxide enters the plant and water
      escapes,
      does not take place during the day at the same time as photosynthesis, but instead occurs at night. The plant
      stores the carbon
      dioxide it takes in as malic acid, retaining it until daylight returns, and only then using it in photosynthesis.
      Because
      transpiration takes place during the cooler, more humid night hours, water loss is significantly reduced.
