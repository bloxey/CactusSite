    <h2>Let's grow a cactus!</h2>

    <h3>Why should we grow cactus?</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>
      Cactuses should be grown in your household because of their spectacular flowers, most of the cactuses are unique
      with their shape
      So, if you're a lazy person, this might be the best plant in your household, since they are soo easy to take care
      of. What's best about cactuses?
      That they thrive in poor soil, which means you don't need them to water every day.
    </p>

    <h3>What's the best pot for cactus?</h3>
    <p> It actually doesn't matter, because they just need soil and a bit of water, so if you'll put your cactus in any
      kind of clay pot, it will grow like a strong boiiiii</p>
    <hr>

    <h3> Yet..You need to choose correct soil ( Do you? ) </h3>
    <p>
      Some old people say that soil still matters, but in these days scientists have proven that you need just top soil,
      which is taken near red pines and your boyooo will grow stronk

    <h3>Here comes the big question - What cactus type you want</h3>
    <p>
      Since there's too many cactus types, but we totally suggest you to use gymnocalycium mihanovichii, since it's the
      pretiest
    </p>

    <h3>Do the magic</h3>
    <p>
      When soil is chosen, cactus type too, basically put cactus inside pot, add some soil and water it a bit, and
      you're done.
      In about 3 months your cactus will have first flowers.
